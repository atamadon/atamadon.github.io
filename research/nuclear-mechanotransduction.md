# Nuclear Mechanotransduction

This page describes the labâ€™s work on SUN and KASH proteins and their role in nuclear mechanotransduction.

Below is an interactive molecular viewer of the SUN-KASH complex:

## Background

The SUN-KASH protein complex forms a bridge across the nuclear envelope, transmitting mechanical forces from the cytoskeleton to the nucleus. This is crucial for processes such as gene regulation, nuclear positioning, and cellular mechanotransduction.

More details about our methods and findings can be found in our [publications](/publications.html).
