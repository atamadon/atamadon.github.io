# Microbiome

Our lab investigates the gut microbiome using advanced computational models and experimental validation. We focus on understanding community dynamics, host interactions, and the impact of environmental factors.

You can add figures, interactive plots, or embedded PDFs here as needed.

## Current Projects

- Agent-based models of microbial communities
- Finite volume and continuum models for gut biogeography
- Host-microbe metabolic integration
